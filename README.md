Pymake
======
I was tired of bad command line tools for Python. I made one I like. Cool features:

- dependency graph. 
- direct translation of function args into command line parameters
- normal command line tool syntax (not funky like fabric and rake)
- a super helpful magic `sh` function that does magic string formating 
    on local variables

On the agenda is also supporting file dependencies (i.e. timestamps a la make) and other goodies.
